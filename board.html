              <p class="board-bio">Hello! My name is Aileen and I am a senior at Ann Arbor Skyline High School. In ALLY, I am the Chief Editor and Event Coordinator. This year, I found the Racial Discrimination presentation the most exciting since I had the opportunity to meet Tiara Yakini, who works for the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. At school, my favorite subjects are math and science—specifically statistics and environmental science. I love to run cross country and track for Skyline, volunteer at the Humane Society, and go outdoors.</p>

If you ever have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to reach out! I like playing tennis, and I have a pet rabbit named Oreo. My favorite  event so far was the Food Gatherers volunteer event! It was really fun connecting with others and helping the community. Joining ALLY been a very rewarding experience. I’m so grateful to be part of this amazing organization and hope to see you there!</p>
